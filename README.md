# Python source code and misc.
This is the extension from the original source stated in [2].

# Proposed and compared approaches:
- EPST.py contains the proposed approaches.
- bounds.py contains different bounds related to the Chernoff bound.
- task-generator.py contains the task generating routines, especially for generating MATLAB input [1].
- sort_task_set.py contains the task generating routines.
- cprta.py contains the approaches implemented in Python [1].

# How to use?
- python call the corresponding function in EPST.py
- the results will be generated into a folder named comparison.

# Experimental setup in the paper:
- timing.py contains the time measument routines.
- taskset-matlabs100u60.m / taskset-p10s100u60.txt are the input of shown results for utilization 60 generated by Uunifast.
- taskset-matlabs100u70.m / taskset-p10s100u70.txt are the input of shown results for utilization 70 generated by Uunifast.
